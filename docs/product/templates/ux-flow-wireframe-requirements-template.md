## 1. Purpose

{{DEFINE_THE_USER_FLOWS_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE_SCREEN_REQUIREMENTS_AND_LOW_FIDELITY_LAYOUT_EXPECTATIONS}}

This document is not a final visual design system. It should provide enough structure for implementation and QA without prescribing unapproved art, official layouts, or trade dress.

## 2. Source Basis

- {{BUSINESS_OR_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS}}
- {{MVP_OR_RELEASE_SCOPE}}
- {{FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS}}
- {{DATA_OR_RULES_REQUIREMENTS}}
- {{PLAYTEST_FINDINGS_OR_UI_FEEDBACK}}

## 3. UX Context

{{DESCRIBE_THE_SESSION_OR_TASK_CONTEXT_AND_THE_MAIN_QUESTIONS_THE_UI_MUST_HELP_THE_USER_ANSWER}}

Typical questions include:

1. What is my current state?
2. What can I do next?
3. What changed?
4. How do I recover from a mistake or failed save?

## 4. UX Scope

### 4.1 In scope

| Area | UX scope |
|---|---|
| {{AREA}} | {{SCOPE}} |
| {{AREA}} | {{SCOPE}} |

### 4.2 Out of scope

| Area | Excluded UX |
|---|---|
| {{AREA}} | {{EXCLUSION}} |
| {{AREA}} | {{EXCLUSION}} |

## 5. UX Principles

| ID | Principle | UX meaning |
|---|---|---|
| UX-P001 | Session-first | Active-play actions take priority over administrative navigation. |
| UX-P002 | Low interruption | Common actions use compact panels, drawers, or dialogs and return the user to context. |
| UX-P003 | State nearby | Important character, campaign, vow, and save state is visible or one action away. |
| UX-P004 | Interpretation preserved | Mechanical outcomes are clear without writing compulsory narrative consequences. |
| UX-P005 | Manual control | Users can correct values and support variants where safe. |
| UX-P006 | Progressive disclosure | Guidance is available without slowing experienced players. |
| UX-P007 | Safe destructive actions | Delete, reset, import, overwrite, burn, and outcome actions are deliberate. |
| UX-P008 | Provenance visible | Bundled, custom, and user-authored content are distinguishable. |
| UX-P009 | Mobile viable | Core workflows remain usable on supported phone widths. |
| UX-P010 | Accessible by default | Keyboard, focus, labels, contrast, and status announcements are designed in. |
| UX-P011 | {{PRINCIPLE}} | {{MEANING}} |

### Destructive action checklist

- [ ] Action names the affected object and scope.

- [ ] Primary and cancel actions are visually and semantically distinct.
- [ ] Cancel is safe and applies no mutation.

- Place attribution and unofficial-product notices in a discoverable About / Legal area.
- Do not show blocked or unknown content in release builds.
- Keep user-authored journal entries, vows, and custom content clearly separate from bundled content.
