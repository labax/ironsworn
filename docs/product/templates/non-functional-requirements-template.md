## 1. Purpose

{{DEFINE_THE_QUALITY_ATTRIBUTES_CONSTRAINTS_AND_MEASURABLE_SERVICE_LEVELS_FOR_THE_PRODUCT_OR_RELEASE}}

Non-functional requirements must be measurable. Replace vague terms such as “fast,” “secure,” or “accessible” with a test target, supported environment, threshold, or review method.

## 2. Source Basis

- {{BUSINESS_OR_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS}}
- {{MVP_OR_RELEASE_SCOPE}}
- {{FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS}}
- {{DATA_AND_RULES_REQUIREMENTS}}
- {{UX_AND_ACCESSIBILITY_REQUIREMENTS}}
- {{ARCHITECTURE_OR_RELEASE_DECISIONS}}

## 3. Quality Context

{{DESCRIBE_WHICH_USER_DATA_AND_WORKFLOWS_HAVE_THE_HIGHEST_QUALITY_RISK}}

Consider:

- Rules-result accuracy.
- Character, campaign, vow, and journal data loss.
- Local-first storage limitations.
- Long-running campaign data growth.
- Mobile browser usability.
- Content provenance and release compliance.

## 4. Scope and Assumptions

### In scope

- {{QUALITY_AREA_1}}
- {{QUALITY_AREA_2}}
- {{QUALITY_AREA_3}}

### Out of scope

- {{EXCLUSION_1}}
- {{EXCLUSION_2}}

### Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| NFA-001 | {{ASSUMPTION}} | {{METHOD}} |
| NFA-002 | {{ASSUMPTION}} | {{METHOD}} |

## 5. Priority and Measurement Conventions

| Priority | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Must | Required for release unless formally waived with risk acceptance. |
| Should | Important quality target; deferral requires documented impact. |
| Could | Optional improvement. |
| Won't | Explicitly excluded from this release. |

Measurement conventions:

- Browser timings use a documented device/network profile.
- Percentiles require a defined sample size and test environment.
- Storage limits use representative campaign fixtures.
- Accessibility references the agreed WCAG version and level.
- Security requirements identify threat, control, and verification method.
