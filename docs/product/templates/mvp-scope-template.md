## 1. Purpose

{{DEFINE_WHAT_THIS_SCOPE_DOCUMENT_BOUNDS_AND_WHAT_DECISION_IT_SUPPORTS}}

## 2. Source Basis

This scope is based on:

- {{BUSINESS_OR_PRODUCT_DOCUMENT}}
- {{USER_RESEARCH_OR_PLAYTEST_EVIDENCE}}

## 3. MVP Goal

> {{ONE_SENTENCE_MINIMUM_RELEASE_OUTCOME}}

The MVP succeeds when {{PRIMARY_USER}} can {{END_TO_END_OUTCOME}} without {{UNACCEPTABLE_WORKAROUND_OR_RISK}}.

## 4. MVP Principles

| ID | Principle | Meaning for this release |
|---|---|---|
| MP-001 | Minimum but complete | Deliver an end-to-end usable loop rather than isolated controls. |
| MP-002 | Solo-first | Optimize the first release for the primary solo workflow unless explicitly changed. |
| MP-003 | Companion, not replacement | Support play without replacing the rulebook or player interpretation. |
| MP-004 | Persistent and safe | Required user-created data survives normal save and resume behavior. |
| MP-005 | Extensible foundation | Avoid choices that block planned campaign, content, or co-op work. |
| MP-006 | Licensing-conscious | Only approved bundled content is included. |
| MP-007 | {{PRINCIPLE}} | {{MEANING}} |
